# Establishment of the ODIS-Ops GitHub Organisation

## Context and Problem Statement

The ODIS Operations Group is charged with maintaining and advancing the operational integrity of the ODIS Federation: a network of independent data systems exchanging (meta)data over the Web. As much of its work will be technical in nature, and pertain to the creation of (meta)data specifications, guidance, and potentially software code/applications, the Group required a social version control system with project management capabilities.

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Creation of and ODIS-Ops repository in the [IODE GitHub Organization](https://github.com/iodepo)
* Option 2: Creation of a new ODIS-Ops Organization, maintained by the Nodes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 2"

On balance of the Pros and Cons (see below), the creation of a new ODIS-Ops Organization was chosen as most suitable.

### Confirmation

The ADR is confirmed by the existence and use of https://github.com/odis-ops/ for ODIS-Ops activities and hosting its outcomes as appropriate.
Further confirmation of this ADR will arise from well-structured pull requests from/to forks in this repository and those in ODIS Node and coordination repositories (e.g. https://github.com/iodepo/odis-arch).
